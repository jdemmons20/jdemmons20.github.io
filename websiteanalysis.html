<head>Two Good Websites and One Bad  </head>    
<body>
    <p>In this article, I will speak on my perspectives as a consumer, and give my opinions on three websites. The three websites are from <a href="https://www.apple.com/store?afid=p238%7CseIEs444j-dc_mtid_1870765e38482_pcrid_714995330286_pgrid_13945964887_pntwk_g_pchan__pexid__ptid_kwd-10778630_&cid=aos-us-kwgo-brand-apple--slid---product-
" target="_blank">Apple</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">Youtube</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a>. Each one of these sites offer a unique approach to design, navigation, and organization, which impacts usability and overall appeal. Through this comparison, I will highlight what stands out positively and negatively about each platform.</p>

<p>My favorite thing about this website is the simplicity of it. The layout of Apple’s website is primarily one column with a scrolling effect, which I really like because I believe it makes the site extremely user-friendly, both on a desktop and phone. The navigation of this website was user friendly because of the clean drop down menu and search bar at the top of the page.  When looking at the code for Apple’s website, I noticed that it was very clean and modern. HTML5 elements can be found throughout the code, along with evidence of the use of tables throughout. I think that the most noticeable quality that I enjoyed about this website when compared to the other two is their use of colors. The primary colors found on this page is white, black, and gray, which give off a luxurious feel for their products, as the products themselves incorporate more vibrant colors, drawing the user’s attention to them. One little detail that I noticed on Apple’s website was the good organization of it.</p>

<p>One thing that I really liked about Youtube’s website was that there were no popup ads or ads on the sides, they put them in the same areas as the videos. I liked this because it helps the website look less cluttered and more organized. Also, because of this, Youtube’s product, their videos, were the first thing that caught my attention when clicking on the link to the website. When I took a look at the code, evidence of the utilization of HTML5 elements was visible throughout. There is a two column layout on Youtube’s website, with the first hosting accessibility to the main navigation bar, and the second hosting recommended videos for you. I thought that the navigation of the website was well organized, with a clearly identifiable search bar at the top and main categories of videos directly underneath. Youtube has a very recognizable color scheme, with red and white being extremely prominent throughout the website. There were a lot of little details that I enjoyed on this website. Almost all of the thumbnails had a visual appeal and icons, such as the red play button, are used numerous times throughout the site. Also, the utilization of white space was well done and I did not feel as if this website was cluttered at any point.</p> 

<p>Throughout looking through Amazon’s website, there was not much that I liked. I thought that the website was beyond cluttered and difficult to navigate if you didn’t already know the exact product that you were looking for. I already have a predisposition against this website, based on studying Amazon’s antitrust case in a business law class. With this predisposition and having taken a further look into Amazon’s code, my opinion of them making their website confusing, hard to navigate, and overwhelming on purpose is strengthened. Although their code is functional and utilizes HTML5 elements, the overall structure lacks the organization to be considered a modern site in my opinion and also lacks the utilization of tables. The layout of this website is horrendous, as there are numerous columns, deals/products, and ads that all equally compete for the consumers attention. Some of the columns have a scrolling effect while others don’t, which can sometimes be frustrating for users. Because of the plethora of distractions, different colors appear everywhere, which I think disables Amazon from utilizing colors effectively. One little detail about this site that I did not like was the under utilization of white space, and because of this, I felt as if a million pieces of information was being thrown at me.</p> 

<p>In summary, the overall effectiveness of a website depends primarily on its design and user experience. Apple and YouTube are good examples of how simplicity and organization can attract and retain users and customers, while Amazon demonstrates clutter and overwhelming navigation can almost ruin a website. These sites show us the importance of clean code, thoughtful layout, and strategic use of color in creating a good online experience.</p>
