            <h2>My favorite thing about Fall:</h2>
            <p><img src="capi.jpg"></p>
            <p>Since I was in the first grade, fall has always been characterized by me as soccer season. In recent years, the Fall has always been consumed by Carroll College's Men's Soccer Team's confernce season and the most enjoyable part of it (especially when we win) is being able to travel with my best friends all over the Pacific Northwest, all the way from Billings, MT, to Ashland, OR.</p>
