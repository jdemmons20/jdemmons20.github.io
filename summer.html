            <p><img src="swimming.jpg"></p>
            <p>Swimming. I love to swim and summer enables every body of water the opportunity to be jumped into. I grew up swimming competitively all the way until high school, so whenever there is an opportunity to casually swim or race someone I know I am faster than, I can never say no. It makes no difference what type of body of water it is, a lake, river, pool, ocean, or bathtub, because summer time is swimming time.</p>
