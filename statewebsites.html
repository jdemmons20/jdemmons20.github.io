    <h1>Ranking State Websites</h1>
    
    <h2> <a href="https://alaska.gov/" target="_blank">Alaska</a></h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed the colors and design of this website. The subtle blue theme found throughout the page with the mountain and lake background was very appealing to the eyes. Alaska’s website loaded extremely well when I first opened it, and took me to the links I clicked very quickly. The menu was as direct as one could be, but I wasn’t a big fan of the format of the menus because I thought they were rather plain and unappealing. I think the organization of the menus was fantastic though, and it was very clear where to go for whoever would need to use the site, from residents to tourists. I opened the website on  my phone and found that it translated to a different screen ok enough. My only issue was the visuals, the colors and design that I loved on the computer adaptation was not represented well on my phone.</p>
    
    <h2> <a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/" target="_blank">Arkansas</a></h2>
    <p>I think that this website could have been more consistent with a color theme throughout this website. It switched from blue to green for a chunk in the middle. I did really enjoy the background images of the mapped river, in the news section, and the waterfall, in the tourist section. When first opened, the website loads fast and so do the links when you click on them. The menu is easy to navigate and I really like that there is a search bar on the top to help someone find something more specific. One feature that makes this website stand out is their AI service agent. I did not think that this website made it easy nor hard to find something you are looking for, although I do think it would be difficult to find something more specific without utilizing the search bar. When opened on my phone, the content translated over surprisingly well.</p>
    
    <h2> <a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/" target="_blank">Kansas</a></h2>
    <p>I thought that this website underutilized both colors and overall design on their website. The only colors used were blue, white, and red and none of the images used, including background images, stood out or were eye popping. The website loaded up fairly quickly when first opened, as did the links when clicked on. The menu was really easy to navigate and I thought, in general, the entirety of the website was well organized. The biggest issue with the menu and the website in whole was that there were no drop down options. In order to find something more specific, one would have to either use the search bar, or click on links until they found what they were looking for. I opened this website on my phone and it translated to a different sized screen well enough, with the one issue being the first picture of the capitol building being cut in half.</p>
    
     <h2> <a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html" target="_blank">Maine</a></h2>
    <p>Colors could have been utilized more throughout this website, but that feature was overlooked because of the wonderful background images. Both the images used in the main page, the capitol building and a rocky beach during a sunset, were very eye-catching and pleasing. I absolutely loved how as you scrolled down the website, the images slightly moved down as well, a feature that I have yet to see on any other state government website. Apart from the images, there wasn’t much else that I liked too well from this website. Although the website and links clicked on opened clearly, there were no drop down bars. The only way you could find something more specific was by clicking on links and opening new pages, or by using the search bar. The menu was specific enough to make navigating to something not too difficult, but I really disliked the visual appearance that it brought to the website in whole, with the saving grace being the background images. In general, the menu just felt clunky. When I opened this website on my phone, it translated over very nicely.</p>
    
     <h2> <a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">Maryland</a></h2>
    <p>I had a slight bias for judging the colors and design of this website because red is my favorite color. Besides that, something that I really enjoyed about this site was the simplicity of the home page. Visually, I wasn’t a fan of the side bar taking up about a quarter of the screen, but it is needed in my opinion considering that Maryland has by far the smallest home screen when compared to these other four state government sites. The website loaded up quickly, as did the links when clicked upon. When I opened this website on my phone, I almost liked it more because it was still extremely simple and the sidebar was hidden, which I thought helped the visual appeal. I think the main reason why Maryland could get away with such a simple homepage was because of how organized it was. To counter that point, I think it would not be so easy to find something without using the search bar or by opening up additional links.</p>
    
    <h2>My Rankings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1. Alaska: I liked this website the best because of the colors and design, as well as the organization throughout this website.</li>
        <li>2. Maryland: The simplicity and the utilization of their flags colors makes this my second favorite website.</li>
        <li>3. Arkansas: The reason why Arkansas is in the middle was beacuse I do not think that they did anything bad, bust I also do not think that did anything particularly well.</li>
        <li>4. Maine: I put Maine slightly over Kansas simply because I enjoyed the colors and design of their website more. Their saving grace was the background images, which I thought that they did better than the other four states.</li>
        <li>5. Kansas: Kansas was my least favorite website because the colors and design were poor, there was no drop down bars, and when I opened the site on my phone, the image of the capitol building was cut in half.</li>
    </ul>
