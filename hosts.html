    <p>HostGator’s plans start at $2.64 a month for a 3-year term, and their top tier plan is priced at $5.04 a month for a 3-year term. With all of their plans, HostGator throws in a free domain for a year. All of their plans, from their hatchling plan to their business plan, include unmetered bandwidth, domain registration, SSL certificates, malware installs, and one click WordPress installs. One good reason why you should choose HostGator is that they are trusted by professionals, with ⅓ of their customers being web pros.</p>

    <h2>My Recommendation</h2>
    <p>The web hosting site that I would recommend using is Bluehost. I would recommend BlueHost because of their relationship with WordPress, which they have been working with since 2005. Also they provide free SSL certificates, which help safeguard your personal and business information, on top of a free domain for a year. Out of these three web hosting sites, BlueHost is the most expensive, but their prices are not far off of GoDaddy’s, which I believe to be reasonable considering the reliability that BlueHost provides. </p>
